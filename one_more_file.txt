Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are the copy of someones Github repository oin your Github account. I will use to get info/ code samples from someone else to review learn from it
Clones are exchanges of files between Github account and my local machine. I will use them to update my Github account or local files
Branches are vey useful when you try amend the code and not sure if it's good ot bad (95% of your time when you code)


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can have more control over the versions..

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
would be hader as i would use messangers and emails...
